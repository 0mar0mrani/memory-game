# Memory Game
This is a memory game with images of my dog built with HTML, CSS and JS. The rules are simple: match 2 identical images before you've reached max attempts. 

See a live demo [here](https://memory-game-oro.netlify.app).

## Features 
- The logic of the game works regardless, meaning you can change the values of numbersOfUniqueCards and numbersOfIdenticalCards in the code and it will handle it (except from layout if there are too many cards).
- 3D animation when you flip and hover on the cards.
